== Description ==

Image Gallery + Photo Gallery + Portfolio Gallery + Tiled Gallery in 1 plugin. Includes lightbox and hover effects. It supports Pinterest (masonry) photo gallery and tiled grid gallery.

= A Brand New Algorithm =

There are dozens of wordpress photo galleries out there, but the problem is that they always look the same!
Final Tiles Grid Gallery uses a brand new algorithm to make much more interesting image grids, how does it work?
The main concept is very simple: it doesn't crop the images and it keeps the original size (if possible). 

This is a completely new way to build photo galleries because now you can think of the images like they were tiles with different sizes, so you can use a bigger size for a cover image, for example.

The image photo gallery is fully responsive and it adapts to the browser using a nice and smooth animation, even on mobile devices because it can use the hardware acceleration taking advantage of CSS3 properties.

This gallery plugin is perfect for you if you need:

* wedding album photo gallery
* designer portfolio photo gallery
* photography portfolio photo gallery
* products showcase photo gallery

= Features =

* responsive
* 2 available layouts: Tiles and Columns (masonry)
* adjust margin between images
* adjust image rendered size based on current screen size
* sort images manually or randomly
* 1 lightbox + support for [EverlightBox](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/everlightbox/)
* social sharing
* video gallery

= PRO version features =

**SAVE 30%** with the bundle [CREATIVE Pack](https://www.final-tiles-gallery.com/wordpress/bundle) 

Final Tiles Gallery Lite is a very complete plugin but if you want the best experience consider buying a PRO license. The PRO version has all features of Lite version plus:

* filters / categories
* 7 lightbox +  support for [EverlightBox](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/everlightbox/)
* different lightbox for mobile devices
* caption hover effects
* image hover effects
* image loaded effects
* WooCommerce support
* recent posts / custom posts galleries

If you love the Lite version and it’s enough for your needs but you want to say “thanks!” you can always buy a [present](http://amzn.eu/5SP6qpj) ;)

If you instead want to upgrade and unlock all the cool features then you can [buy a license](https://www.final-tiles-gallery.com/wordpress/pricing).

The “Final” layout can’t ensure you have a justified edge at the bottom of the gallery. If you have this requirement then you can use the “Masonry” layout and use images with same height, that way you can make a justified gallery.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The layout doesnt' look correct =

Check the console of the browser and look if you see any error like: Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function jquery.finalTilesGalleryLite.js
This errors means that the browser doesn't know the finalTilesGalleryLite JavaScript plugin, most of the time the problem is caused by a wrong jQuery
inclusion by the theme or another plugin. 

= Why the images arrange themselves in columns ? =

Columns happen when the bottom edges of the images are not aligned. To avoid this tedious layout you can raise the "Grid size" setting. This will crop a few pixels but it raises the chances to avoid columns.

= How to get beautiful grids ? =

Have a look at this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNT4JGjtyrs)


= Why does some image look blurry ? =

Under some circumstances the images have to be enlarged a bit to avoid gaps. To avoid a blurry effect you can decrease the "Image size factor" setting. 

= I want to use another lightbox instead of the provided one =

The PRO license bundles 7 different lightboxes. However you can use any other lightbox you want also with the Lite license. If you have installed a lightbox plugin then you just need to select "Direct link to image" in the "Lightbox" settings.

= Can I import galleries from other plugins? =

Currently galleries made with Envira, FooGallery, Instagram, NextGen, JetPack, Modula, etc cannot be imported.

= How can I get support? =

* Get priority support with a PRO license: http://www.final-tiles-gallery.com/wordpress/pricing
